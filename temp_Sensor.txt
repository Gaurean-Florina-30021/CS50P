1.connect sensor onm GPIO4(pin7 on raspberry)
2. Enable 1 wire communication
sudo raspi-config
    go to interfacing options and enable 1-Wire
    go to finish after eneble-ing it


3. Make sure you have the configuration of the sensor
sudo nano /boot/config.txt

add this if it is not already there:
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4
            if you are having issues with the syntax or at the end it wont work please have a look in this file to see the exactly syntax you need to use:
            sudo /boot/overlays/README
4. Restart the device
sudo reboot

5. Load the w1-gpio kernel module, which is responsible for enabling the GPIO pin for one-wire communication:
sudo modprobe w1-gpio

6.Load the w1-therm kernel module, which adds support for DS18B20-specific features,
sudo modprobe w1-therm

7.make sure you are as up as it is possible:
    cd ..

8. Verify if your device was added:
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices/
ls

If this step do not show anything or only show w1-master than please check your device wiring.
After that repeat steps 5 and 6. Also consider a restart if it is not working!
Also if nothing works do this:
lsmod | grep -i w1_
and
dmesg | grep w1
And see if you spot any errors.
If there are any errors or warnings related to loading the modules or detecting the sensor, they should appear in the output.
This information can help diagnose the issue and determine the next steps to resolve it.
After running the command, please review the output and see if there are any relevant messages.

9. Get the one prefixed with 28- and replace it in the temp_reader.py line 12
