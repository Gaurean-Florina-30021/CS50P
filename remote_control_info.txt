The code for reading the keyboards from the Car mp3 IR(Infra Red) Remote control.
The code was provided by akkana from github:
    https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/rpi/pyirw.py
For the folowing code to work there might be needed to do some additional steps to configure the remote control used.
This project may work with other remote controls too but not as expected if the buttons are not the same.

Remote control configuration:
1. First it is needed to intal the lirc(Linux Infra Red Control) package.
    This can be done with the following command in the commands window:
        sudo apt update                             -> Update the system
        sudo apt install lirc                       -> install lirc package
        lircd --version                             -> Verify version(lircd 0.10.1)
        sudo nano /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf       -> Change lirc options

            Options to change:
                driver          = default
                device          = /dev/lirc0

        sudo reboot                                 -> reboot the system

        sudo /etc/init.d/lircd status               -> See the status lirc deaomon

                    ● lircd.service - Flexible IR remote input/output application support
                    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/lircd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

                    <http://lirc.org/html/configure.html>
                    Main PID: 520 (lircd)

                    CGroup: /system.slice/lircd.service
                            └─520 /usr/sbin/lircd --nodaemon

        May also see that it's running


2. Now we need to configure that the lirc accepts the IR transmission:
    sudo nano /boot/config.txt                          -> open config.txt
        Inside we can find 2 lines commented like those:
            #dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=17
            #dtoverlay=gpio-ir-tx,gpio_pin=18
        Uncomment the first one and if the case change the pin from 17 to any pin you want to use(I will use 18)
        The second line will enable the raspbery to take place of a remote so the commands will be transmitted via code commands. (We do not need it)

    sudo reboot                                         -> reboot system again

    sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 --disable-namespace     ->record the IR signals from our remote(THIS COMMAND MAY NOT WORK. DO NOT WORRY!!!
                                                                    IT'S NORMAL EIGHTER IT WORK EIGHTER NOT DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM VERSION)

    sudo mode2 -m -d /dev/lirc0                         -> After this command it should work and wait for you to press keys from the remote.


3. In a file save the codes as mentioned in this link: https://asimuzzaman.com/posts/how-to-use-raspberry-pi-as-infrared-ir-remote#hardware-1

4. Write saved data in correct format specified in the same link:
    sudo nano remot_name.lircd.config               -> create the file where shall be saved the data in the correct format4

5. coppy the configuration to the needed folder:
    sudo cp TV_REMOTE.lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd

6. Reboot and verify if the remote appear:
     irsend LIST "" ""                              -> will show all available remotes
     irsend LIST remote_name ""                     -> will show the available keys

7. Test in Visual studio:
    pip install lirc                                -> install library
    in terminal write "irw" and press the remotes key see if the keys are detected. Soma key may not be detected.. If so repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 changing in the file only the buttons that does not work.





In order to work the lirc package it is needed to have this software(OS) version installed on the raspberry pi4:
PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"
NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="10"
VERSION="10 (buster)"
VERSION_CODENAME=buster
ID=raspbian
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianForums"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianBugs

Debian version => 10.4

To check them use:
    cat /etc/debian_version
    cat /etc/os-release

If you DO NOT USE the specified version it may be required to do some more steps to make lirc package work or the
lirc package may NOT BE COMPATIBLE and recording keys may need additional code implementation.
In that case get this as refference to read the keys from the remote:
